# meteor-react-starter
This is a starter meteor / react / bootstrap starter app with basic layout, routing, user authentication.

**Why?** Because DRY and we've been doing quite a lot of new meteor apps lately, so having a starter template that takes care of the tedious issues such as adding authentication, routing, basic layouts, design templates etc was a bliss.

So, simply `git clone` and use!
